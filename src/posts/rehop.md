### Project Description

ReHop is an all-in-one platform for managing your links.

- Branded URL Shortening
- Analytics if you dont have your own (visitors, devices and locations)
- QR Code Generation, with custom designs, logo, free export to svg or png, everything local-sided so your data is safe.

The web app provides a clean dashboard built for simplicity. Easily manage links individually, organize them into folders, and rest assured that our system ensures your external analytics tools correctly detect the original traffic source.

### Why I built it

I built this project as I have finished my template for saas projects which includes payments, full auth, mailer, gRPC setup, self-hosting on kubernetes and more. My first project with it is ReHop. Also I couldn't think of a project where I'd be able to use charts and analytics, so I thought why not go with a URL shortener with analytics.
