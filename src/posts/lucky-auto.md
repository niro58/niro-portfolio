### Project Description

This project has been a lot of fun. Initially, it was a basic website providing information about the car repair shop and a simple reservation system for their services.

Over time, it evolved into a more complex website. As of July 26, 2025, it contains approximately 1,000 total pages (around 500 in Czech and 500 in Russian), primarily created for SEO purposes. These pages include blog posts, information about the manufacturers they work with, and the specific models they can repair.

Also this project was a great learning experience for me, as I had to learn a lot about SEO and how to create content that ranks well in search engines, ways to create website with a large amount of pages.

**Plans to improve:**

- Add a chatbot for customer support to assist with reservations and answer general questions about the car repair shop.
- Add detailed pages about all the services they offer.
- Add pages with descriptions of all the cities and villages around their service area for SEO purposes.
