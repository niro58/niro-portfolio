### Project Description

Tivoku Image Resizer is a simple web application that allows users to resize images directly in their browser. It uses Ffmpeg WASM for image processing, enabling users to upload images and resize them without needing a server-side component.
The application is 100% client-side, meaning all processing happens in the user's browser, making it fast, efficient, and secure for the user.
I know that there are many image resizers out there, but I have never built one myself, so I wanted to try it out.
