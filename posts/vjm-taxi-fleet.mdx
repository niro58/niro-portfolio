# Journey of Improving Data Management

About a year ago, back in December 2022, I took on a significant task as I joined the company. The company was expanding its vehicle options, adding to long-range trucks also short-distance deliveries. This transition prompted me to rethink manual processes, especially when it came to handling cash, calculating invoices, and addressing potential salary discrepancies with drivers.

## Getting Started and Early Hurdles

We began by focusing on the Bolt platform, and I dabbled with Python and Microsoft Power BI, even though I wasn't very experienced with either. The initial phase involved transforming Bolt invoices into Excel rows for analysis. While this helped with some challenges, figuring out accurate driver salaries, especially with night shifts, proved tricky.

## Learning and Adapting

As my understanding of Power BI grew, I kept refining the system. Initially, I tried selecting the first and last orders to calculate driver hours, but it had its flaws. The breakthrough came when I formulated a Power BI solution that considered the difference between consecutive orders and the total ride time, providing a more accurate outcome.

By spring 2023, the system faced challenges with increased data volume, leading me to shift calculations to Excel. I also introduced features like tracking vehicle expenses, driver shift expenses, office expenses, and vehicle fuel expenses through GPS APIs.

## Comprehensive Changes in Autumn 2023

With more programming experience, I decided to overhaul the entire system in autumn 2023. This included migrating data storage to MongoDB for better efficiency. A notable change was rewriting all scripts in C#(I have had much more experience in at the time), given the different data structures across platforms without APIs.

## Optimizing Power BI and User Experience

Post-MongoDB migration, I dedicated time to understanding Power BI better. The result was a web version with incremental refresh, refreshed schedules, and an improved design. This version allowed users to concentrate on data rather than navigating numerous buttons. The optimization also streamlined data processing, enabling quick and efficient calculations within Power BI.

## Present State and Future Growth

As of the start of 2024, the company added to its current used platforms (Uber, Bolt) also their personal franchise of the Ukrainian platform OnTaxi. Power BI remains a key tool in handling driver KPIs on this new platform, contributing to more effective operations.
